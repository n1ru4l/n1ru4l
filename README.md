Currently working on [Cyanite.ai](https://cyanite.ai/) and doing awesome open source stuff at [The Guild](https://github.com/the-guild-org).

I am also building [Dungeon Revealer](https://github.com/dungeon-revealer/dungeon-revealer), [OBS Character Overlay](https://github.com/n1ru4l/character-overlay) and other useful stuff in my free time.
